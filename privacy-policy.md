# Internship Tracker Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** January 18, 2026

Internship Tracker is a Chrome extension that helps users save internship job posting details and export them in a spreadsheet-ready format.

## Data Collection

Internship Tracker does **not** collect, transmit, sell, or share personal data with the developer or any third parties.

## Data Storage

Internship entries (such as company, role, location, application date, status, and job posting URL) are stored **locally on the user’s device** using Chrome’s `chrome.storage.local`. This data remains on the user’s device and is not sent to any external servers.

## Permissions

Internship Tracker uses the following permissions:

- **storage**: to save and manage internship entries locally
- **activeTab** and **scripting**: to read job posting information from the current tab for optional auto-fill functionality (e.g., page title or header)
- **clipboardWrite**: to copy TSV-formatted rows to the clipboard when the user requests it

## Data Sharing

Internship Tracker does not share any user data with third parties.

## Data Deletion

Users can delete individual entries or remove all saved entries through the extension’s Manage view. Uninstalling the extension removes all locally stored data associated with it.
